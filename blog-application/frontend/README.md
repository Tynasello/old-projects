A React.js TypeScript blog application where users can view and interact with posts. Frontend makes use of [custom blog API](https://github.com/Tynasello/blog-api).

Live Demo: [https://tynasello.github.io/blog-frontend](https://tynasello.github.io/blog-frontend) (because of Heroku's base tier, server takes some time to boot up and fetch posts).

To be the admin of this blog, login with username: "admin" and password: "adminpass". This will allow you the ability to create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as delete post comments.

### Built With: 
- TypeScript
- React.js
- styled-components
- gh-pages.

Inspiration for this project was found while following the tutorials on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com), and advancing to the [NodeJS Project: Blog API](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/nodejs/lessons/blog-api) section.
